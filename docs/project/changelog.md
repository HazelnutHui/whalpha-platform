# Changelog

## 2026-08-14

- Hardened Massive Grouped Daily numeric parsing for JSON int, finite float, Decimal, and numeric string inputs while rejecting bool, non-finite values, malformed strings, and fractional integer-semantic fields.
- Fixed Grouped Daily processing so identity classification is counted before numeric validation and remains independent from OHLCV parse failures.
- Changed low-ratio conflicting duplicate bars from a hard session failure to isolated quality warnings, while preserving a hard gate above the accepted ratio.
- Re-ran the authorized 2026-08-13 Grouped Daily request once; identity coverage passed, but numeric conversion failures and canonical bar count gates blocked publication.
- No raw payload, EOD Parquet partition, Dashboard data flow, OCI access, or system change was introduced.

- Added a controlled Massive Grouped Daily publication entrypoint for the completed 2026-08-13 session using the completed point-in-time ticker resolver.
- Executed one authorized Grouped Daily request with `adjusted=false`; access succeeded but quality gates blocked publication.
- Recorded conflicting duplicate bars, numeric conversion failures, low identity coverage, and insufficient canonical bar count as the exact blockers.
- No raw payload, EOD Parquet partition, Dashboard data flow, OCI access, or system change was introduced.

- Refined Massive Instrument Master snapshot quality classification to separate eligible records, expected exclusions, malformed records, ticker ambiguity, and stable-ID collisions.
- Added Provider Ticker Resolver V1 and included it in the logical Instrument Master snapshot completion marker.
- Re-ran the authorized 2026-08-13 Massive All Tickers pagination once; corrected quality gates passed and published 9,932 canonical instruments, 13,106 provider identity records, and 9,932 resolver entries.
- No raw Massive payload, Grouped Daily call, Dashboard data flow, OCI access, or system change was introduced.

- Added Provider Instrument Identity V1 as a Python contract and data-contract document.
- Accepted ADR 0009 for stable provider identifiers and deterministic UUIDv5 canonical instrument identity.
- Implemented bounded Massive All Tickers point-in-time Instrument Master snapshot ingestion with fixed-interval pagination.
- Implemented Instrument Master and provider identity Parquet snapshot repositories with logical completion marker semantics.
- Executed one live Massive All Tickers snapshot attempt for 2026-08-13; pagination completed, but quality gates blocked publication.
- No raw provider payload, completed Instrument Master snapshot, Grouped Daily publication, Dashboard data flow, OCI access, or system change was introduced.

- Added a safe one-request Massive Grouped Daily inspection tool.
- Executed one read-only Grouped Daily inspection for 2026-08-13 with `adjusted=false`.
- Verified Grouped Daily access and payload structure without saving raw or canonical data.
- Confirmed production publication is blocked pending Instrument Master identity coverage.
- No Parquet write, `/data` write, repository publish, second Massive request, Dashboard data flow, OCI access, or provider-backed deployment was introduced.
- Accepted partitioned Parquet as the initial canonical EOD Price Bar persistence format.
- Implemented a one-session provider-neutral EOD ingestion service for mocked fixtures.
- Implemented an explicit PyArrow EOD Price Bar V1 Parquet repository, manifest, deterministic content fingerprint, atomic publish, idempotency, and conflict/corruption checks.
- Added mocked-fixture ingestion and Parquet persistence tests.
- No Massive API call, credential access, production `/data` write, scheduler, historical backfill, analytics, database, Dashboard API, or OCI deployment was introduced.
- Implemented the protected Massive credential-file loader.
- Implemented a minimal standard-library HTTPS transport using Authorization bearer headers.
- Added local security tests for credential parsing, transport behavior, error mapping, redirect handling, and network prohibition.
- Verified one read-only Massive Stocks reference smoke test without outputting raw data or credentials.
- No ingestion, Grouped Daily download, persistence, Dashboard data flow, OCI deployment, or public provider-backed access was introduced.
- Implemented the Massive Stocks configuration and credential boundary.
- Added a mocked-only Massive adapter skeleton for Instrument Master and EOD Price Bars.
- Added deterministic mocked HTTP response tests for Massive mapping, error handling, pagination, and credential redaction.
- No real API key, Massive API call, market-data download, persistence, provider-backed deployment, or access-control change was introduced.
- Evaluated Massive Stocks Basic using official public documentation.
- Accepted Massive Stocks Basic as the first private EOD development provider.
- Documented public-display and Derived Works restrictions for provider-backed data.
- Accepted the public placeholder, public data-free demo, and private real-data dashboard boundary.
- No account, credential, adapter, API request, data ingestion, deployment, or access-control change was introduced.
- Implemented the synchronous provider-neutral MarketDataProvider Protocol.
- Added provider capabilities and query models for Instrument Master and EOD Price Bars.
- Added explicit provider error taxonomy.
- Added deterministic in-memory provider contract test fake.
